# Description:book:

```
Just Another Text Editor (JATE) is an app that can function with or without an internet connection.  So go on and take some notes.  We'll remember it for you.
```

# User Story:feelsgood:

 I am bloody sick of my entire arsenal of technology being rendered useless whenever my bloody internet decides it's tired.  I want to make notes with or without the internet and I want it to be saved for later perusal.
